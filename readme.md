## Deploy

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

We make it easy to deploy as a free Heroku app.

Just press the button above and fill in the following environment variables:

__GS_APP_URL__: `<heroku-app-name>`.herokuapp.com

The `<heroku-app-name>` is the name that you choosed for your app on Heroku.

This Url will be used as base for the callback Url on the OAuth2 auth flow.

If you'll use your on domain after the deploy, you need to change this variable on the app settings tab.

__GS_SESSION_SECRET__: This is the secret used to sign the session ID cookie, used by [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session/#secret).

__GS_GRAPHQL_URL__: Your GraphQL endpoint.

__GS_OAUTH2_AUTORIZATION_URL__: Your OAuth2 autorization endpoint.

__GS_OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL__: Your OAuth2 token endpoint.

__GS_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID__: Your OAuth2 client ID.

__GS_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET__: Your OAuth2 client secret.


## Features

- Supports only OAuth2 authentication flow now, in a simple way. (We need your help to make it better and add more :)
- Proxy all the GraphQL API calls through the server, this way the tokens only live in the server side and it's possible to use API's without CORS enabled.


## To do's

- Add support for others authentication methods.
- Any idea? [Open an issue](https://github.com/digitalnatives/graphiql-server/issues/new) and let's talk :)
